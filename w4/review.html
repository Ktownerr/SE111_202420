            <p><b>Keagan Towner</b> <i>January 29,2024</i></p>
            <p>Its been a about a year since I last watched <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> but I'll still try and convey how I feel about the movie with the most accuracy possible. Lets start with costuming, I really appreaciate how the survivors at first are all wearing the clothes they were wearing when the outbreak first happened but then as the film goes on the outfits change to more of what you would find in a mall at the time. Its simple but if I was directing the movie I might have forgetten I placed my characters in a mall with more clothes. The zombies also look really cool and the amount of blood used is so over the top ridiculous that it works perfectly. I also like the set design a whole lot, Snyder does not shy away from using every ounce of every store in this film. As the movie progresses the survivors are seen decorating the part of the mall they stay in which I think is really cool. The writing of the film along with the dialoluge for sure isnt anything special but it gets the job done in an entertaining. My favorite scene in <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> is when the survivors try and leave the mall in the buses and it looks like every zombie ever is surrounding the buses, it's almost like the survivors is showing the last spark of humanity and how hard theyre fighting for it. Anyway its just a silly zombie movie but its definitely worth a watch.</p>
